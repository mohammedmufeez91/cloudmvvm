## About the app

This is open weather app clone which serves as a mock to create the skeleton of any project 


## Architecture

## Design

- Design for the app is inspired from [Furkansin](https://github.com/furkanaskin/Weatherapp).
- Weather icons are taken from [Icons8](https://icons8.com/icon/set/weather/color) under its free-tier subscription.
